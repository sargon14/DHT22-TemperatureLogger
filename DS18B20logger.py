# This script is intended to use with Adafruit DHT22 temperature and humidity

# script alone, without sensor/s to provide data for it doesn't really do
# anything useful. For guidance how to create your own temperature logger that
# makes use of this script, Adafruit DHT22 sensors and raspberry pi, visit :
